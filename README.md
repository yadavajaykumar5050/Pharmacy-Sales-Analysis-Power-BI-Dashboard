Unlocking Insights with Pharmacy Data Analysis Dashboards! 💊

Data analytics is revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry, enabling smarter decision-making and optimizing processes across the supply chain. Recently, I developed a Pharmacy Data Analysis Dashboard designed to provide actionable insights into sales trends, inventory levels, and prescription patterns.

🔍 Key Features of the Dashboard:
Sales Analysis – Tracks daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance.
Inventory Management – Monitors stock levels to avoid shortages or overstocking.
Prescription Trends – Identifies high-demand medications and seasonal variations.
Customer Insights – Analyzes buying behavior to enhance customer satisfaction.
Profitability Metrics – Evaluates revenue streams and cost-efficiency.

💡 Impact:
Improved inventory turnover rates by identifying slow-moving products.
Enhanced forecasting accuracy to streamline procurement.
Boosted profit margins through data-driven pricing strategies.
